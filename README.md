Most of my own repositories are mirrorred from [gitea.blesmrt.net](https://gitea.blesmrt.net/mikaela?tab=activity)
just for showcasing instead of developed on GitHub, due to having been a [PrivacyTools Team Member](https://web.archive.org/web/20210922131757/https://privacytools.io/about/)
(nowadays known as [PrivacyGuides](https://privacyguides.org/)) and thus introduced to [concerns](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/763) with [Microsoft'](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/843)s [GitHub](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1062) such as [drop ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice)
and [GitHub do not ban us from open source world](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).

In general I am mostly reporting issues, changing documentation or maintaining
small scripts or files of some use to me.

* [Mikaela.info](https://mikaela.info/) has further information on contacting me
  (through Matrix, XMPP, etc.) and other git forges.
  * [List of IRC networks/accounts](https://mikaela.info/txt/irc.txt) & [my public chat rooms](https://mikaela.info/discuss)
    have their own files or pages.
* GitHub hosted public [SSH](https://github.com/Mikaela.keys) and [GPG](https://github.com/Mikaela.gpg) keys.
  * See also [me/ in pgp-alt-wot](https://github.com/Mikaela/pgp-alt-wot/tree/master/me) and [authorized_keys in shell-things](https://github.com/Mikaela/shell-things/blob/master/.mikaela/keys/authorized_keys).
