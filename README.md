Hi üëãüèª

Most of my own repositories are on [gitea.blesmrt.net](https://gitea.blesmrt.net/mikaela?tab=activity),
due to having been a [PrivacyTools Team Member](https://privacytools.io/about/)
and thus introduced to [concerns](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/763) with [Microsoft'](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/843)s [GitHub](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1062) such as [drop ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice)
and [GitHub do not ban us from open source world](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).

However I am considering mirroring my repositories here once in the future
once Gitea can do it automatically, which is expected to happen in Gitea 1.15.0
currently being in rc3 state at the time of writing.

In general I am mostly reporting issues, changing documentation or maintaining
small scripts or files of some use to me.

* [Mikaela.info](https://mikaela.info/) has my contact details and other sites.
* Pronouns: ≈ùi/≈ùin/≈ùia or other feminine/neutral ones.
  * [The ≈ù can be denoted as sh or sx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutions_of_the_Esperanto_alphabet).
