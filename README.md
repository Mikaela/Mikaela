Hi üëãüèª

![GitHub README Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Mikaela&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=cobalt)

Most of my own repositories are mirrorred from [gitea.blesmrt.net](https://gitea.blesmrt.net/mikaela?tab=activity)
just for showcasing instead of developed on GitHub, due to having been a [PrivacyTools Team Member](https://privacytools.io/about/)
and thus introduced to [concerns](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/763) with [Microsoft'](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/843)s [GitHub](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1062) such as [drop ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice)
and [GitHub do not ban us from open source world](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).

In general I am mostly reporting issues, changing documentation or maintaining
small scripts or files of some use to me.

* [Mikaela.info](https://mikaela.info/) has my contact details and other sites.
* Pronouns: ≈ùi/≈ùin/≈ùia or other feminine/neutral ones.
  * [The ≈ù can be denoted as sh or sx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutions_of_the_Esperanto_alphabet).
