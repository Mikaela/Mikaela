Hi üëãüèª

![GitHub README Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Mikaela&count_private=true&show_icons=true&theme=cobalt)

Most of my own repositories are mirrorred from [gitea.blesmrt.net](https://gitea.blesmrt.net/mikaela?tab=activity)
just for showcasing instead of developed on GitHub, due to having been a [PrivacyTools Team Member](https://privacytools.io/about/)
and thus introduced to [concerns](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/763) with [Microsoft'](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/843)s [GitHub](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1062) such as [drop ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice)
and [GitHub do not ban us from open source world](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).

In general I am mostly reporting issues, changing documentation or maintaining
small scripts or files of some use to me.

* [Mikaela.info](https://mikaela.info/) has my contact details and other sites.
* GitHub hosted public [SSH](https://github.com/Mikaela.keys) and [GPG](https://github.com/Mikaela.keys).
  * See also [me/ in pgp-alt-wot](https://github.com/Mikaela/pgp-alt-wot/tree/master/me) and [authorized_keys in shell-things](https://github.com/Mikaela/shell-things/blob/master/.mikaela/keys/authorized_keys).
