Most of my own repositories are mirrorred from [gitea.blesmrt.net](https://gitea.blesmrt.net/mikaela?tab=activity)
just for showcasing instead of developed on GitHub, due [to some of my positions](https://cv.aminda.eu/) and thus getting introduced to [concerns](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/763) with [Microsoft'](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/843)s [GitHub](https://github.com/privacytools/privacytools.io/issues/1062) such as [Microsoft: Drop ICE](https://github.com/selfagency/microsoft-drop-ice)
and [GitHub, do not ban us from open source world](https://github.com/1995parham/github-do-not-ban-us).

In general I am mostly reporting issues, changing documentation or maintaining
small scripts or files of some use to me.

* [Aminda.eu](https://www.aminda.eu/) has further information on contacting me
